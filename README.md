# MIPS-SingleCycle-Design-Verification

![MIPS Architecture](https://i.sstatic.net/5d5XB.png)
> Based on *Computer Organization and Design*, 5th Edition â€“ Patterson & Hennessy - But this pic does not support all insturctions of MIPS....Will add Custom Made one that support all soon ISA.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements a **single-cycle MIPS processor** following the textbook model from *Computer Organization and Design, 5th Ed* by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy. It includes:

- Complete RTL hardware design
- A structured testbench
- Full coverage for **all 97 MIPS instructions tested randomly that cover all MIPS instructions**
- Simulation and verification using **QuestaSim**

The goal is to provide a robust reference design and verification environment for educational and professional use.
